Jaydev Unadkat, the left-arm pacer, has been called up to the India squad for the Test series in Bangladesh. Unadkat, who bowled Saurashtra to the Vijay Hazare Trophy win recently, has been picked in place of Mohammed Shami who, as recently reported by Cricbuzz has been ruled out of the series due to a bowling arm stress. India is set to play two Tests in Bangladesh.
