Should Unadkat get to play in either of the Tests in Bangladesh, he will be setting a record for the lengthiest gap between two Tests by an Indian cricketer, which is currently held by Parthiv Patel. The 31-year-old left-arm pacer played his only Test in 2010, against South Africa in Centurion. Since then, he has played seven ODIs and 10 Twenty20 Internationals but was never considered for the five-day game.
